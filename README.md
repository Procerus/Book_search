##Good Reads Scrape Function
Parses through GoodReads for quotes from your favorite author and creates a text file of the top quotes. To get the list of quotes change the url to the author you like on goodreads and the program will scrape through all the pages and download all the quotes in a text file. 

##Display Function
This is just a print out of a random quote in the saved text file. I changed the bash file in my computer to run this function so that whenever I open a new terminal I am greeted with a quote.
